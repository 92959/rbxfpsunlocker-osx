The first Roblox FPS unlocker for macOS. This script works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Setup

You will need to follow the steps below:

1. Open a new terminal window and download the script using `curl -sfLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/92959/rbxfpsunlocker-osx/testing/install_fps_unlocker`
2. Make the script executable using `chmod +x ./install_fps_unlocker`
3. Run the script using `sh install_fps_unlocker` or...
4. (Optional) Set your custom FPS cap using `./install_fps_unlocker (custom FPS cap number goes here) (Use Vulkan? (yes/no/y/n))`

After executing the script, you should see a confirmation that the unlocker was installed, like this:

*Note: You must run the command again when Roblox updates.*

*Note: If you're using macOS Ventura or newer and your display doesn't support more than 60 Hz **you won't see the effect of this program unless you force Roblox to use Vulkan**. Please don't create issues asking about this.*
