The first Roblox FPS unlocker for macOS. This program works only on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Setup

You can either download the `install_fps_unlocker` script and run it yourself, or use the following command to do it automatically:
```
curl -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanylow/rbxfpsunlocker-osx/script/install_fps_unlocker | sh
```
After executing the script, you should see a confirmation that the unlocker was installed.

*Note: you must run the command again when Roblox updates.*

*Note: if you're using macOS Ventura or newer and your display doesn't support more than 60 Hz **you won't see the effect of this program**. Please don't create issues asking about this.*

*Note: This experimental version of rbxfpsunlocker-osx might ask you for your contacts, or reminders, or calendar, or photos. If it does, click "Don't Allow" or "Cancel". Don't worry, this is normal behavior with find looking in your Full User directory, and is not trying to steal your information.*
